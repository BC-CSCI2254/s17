#### 1. JavaScript Background####

**JavaScript** (aka **JS**) was introduced in the mid-1990s by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) to make web pages active o responsive or dynamic. This was in the era of object-oriented programming. Eich chose to base his new language on the existing programming language [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), a dialect of [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), with 

1. C-like syntax and
2. aspects of the prototype-based object-oriented language [Self](http://www.selflanguage.org/).

**Design Challenges**:

1. language has to deal with UI concerns in a browser; response to asynchronous events (user inputs)
2. language has to deal with asynchronous communication from various servers.

> **FAIR WARNING**: Like many others, your humble instructor is not a believer in object-oriented programming — I'll usually use the word **record** to refer to what OO-types refer to as an **object**. 

**Notes**

1. JS as a programming language vs JS + DOM in the browser;
2. sending JS SOURCE CODE (!) over the wire
   + minification 
3. **ECMAScript**: **ES6** (out in 2015) Following lead of Java 8, Swift, etc, introducing functional features and stressing immutability
4. Frameworks: Angular, React, React Native, Flux, Redux, Vue, etc, ...
5. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): from Microsoft
6. [Flow](https://flowtype.org/): from Facebook
7. JSX — HTML/CSS templates
8. JSON

### 2. Types 

JS is **dynamically typed**: 

+ type information is associated with run-time values rather than variables and program phrases;

+ types are checked for consistency at run-time rather than compile-time;

+ flexibility at the expense of:

  + reliability
  + efficiency
  + scalability

  ```javascript
  typeof 3
  typeof "Boston"
  typeof [1, 2]
  typeof (x => x)
  typeof {id : x => x}
  typeof NaN
  typeof null
  ```

  ​

### 3. Functions 

Two basic forms of syntax (that I know of):

```javascript
1. function (n) { return n * 2; }    /* traditional style */

2 (n => n * 2)                       /* more concise "Arrow" notation introduced in ES6 */
```

NB:

1. In Python, instead of `function` the symbol `lambda` is used `(lambda n : n * 2)`;
2. In Java, version 8 on, one writes `(n -> n * 2)`.

**Naming Functions**

1. By assigning them to a variable or field:

   ```javascript
   var double = function (n) { return n * 2; }

   foo.double = function (n) { return n * 2; }

   var double = (n => n * 2)
   ```


2. Using special syntax:

   ```javascript
   function double(n) { return n * 2; }

   {
     double : function (n) { return n * 2; }
     triple(n) { return n * 3; }
   }
   ```

More on functions later.

### 4. Records & Objects###

A **record** is a collection of **labeled** **fields** eclosed in curly braces. In JS, records are usually called "objects".

```javascript
let student = {name : "Alice"; age : 20; classOf : 2018}

student.name
student.age
```

In modern programming languages, **functions are values** so record fields can contain functions.

```javascript
let student = {
  name : "Alice", 
  age : 20, 
  classOf : 2018,
  getClass : function () { return 2018; }    // This isn't ideal -- 2018 occurs in two places!
}
```

**Recursive Records (aka objects)**

```javascript
let student = {
  name : "Alice",                             
  age : 20, 
  classOf : 2018,
  getClass : function () { return classOf; },       // FAILS!!!!! No such thing as classOf
}
```

The special variable `this` is bound to the whole record. (!)

```javascript
let student = {
  name : "Alice",
  age : 20, 
  classOf : 2018,
  getClass : function () { return this.classOf; },
}
```

**Constructors**

```javascript
function Student (name, age, clas) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.classOf = clas;
    this.getClass = function() { return this.classOf; };
}

var alice = new Student("Alice", 20, 2018);
```

**NB:** The symbol `Student` is a **constructor** (!) note that it is capitalized.

**Extensible Records** 

```javascript
alice.major = "Computer Science"
```

`alice` now has a `major` field.

```javascript
alice = {
  name : "Alice",                             
  age : 20, 
  classOf : 2018,
  getClass : function () { return this.class; },
  major : "Computer Science"
}
```

**Prototypes**

```javascript
function Student(name, age, cls) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.class = cls;
    this.getClass = function () { return this.class; }
}

var alice = new Student("Alice", 20, 2018);

console.log(alice.name + " " + alice.major);   // alice.major is Undefined

Student.prototype.setMajor = function (m) { this.major = m; }   // NB: funky use of this.

var bob = new Student("Bob", 21, 2017);

alice.setMajor("Computer Science");
console.log(alice.name + " " + alice.major);          // Alice Computer Science
bob.setMajor("Math");
console.log(bob.name + " " + bob.major);              // Bob Math
```

### 5 Variables & Scope; let and var###

**Scope**

**Scope** is a property of non-keyword *symbols*. When symbols are introduced in some program phrase, they can be used or referenced in some areas of code but not in others.  Programming languages have **binding forms** for the purpose of introducing names.

```javascript
var square = function (n) { return n * n; }
```

The function form is a binding form, it introduces the symbol `n` in the parentheses. There are three occurrences of `n` in the code, the leftmost (the one in the parentheses) is called a **binding occurrence**. The two occurrences on the right (i.e., in `n * n`) are called **uses** or **applied occurrences** of `n`. Technically, the word scope refers to a set of applied occurrences. Using numbering to illustrate:

```javascript
var square = function (n0) { return n1 * n2; }
var square = function (n3) { return n4 * ((n5 => n5)(n6)); }
```

We would say that **scope**(`n0`) = { `n1`, `n2` } and that **scope**(`n3`) = { `n4`, `n6` }.

**Closures**

```javascript
"use strict";                   // make node.js accept let

let k = (x => (y => x));        // when the (y => x) function is called, we must remember x!

let closure = k(12);            // 12 plugged in for x in k.

function test(x) {
  console.log("x in test    = " + x);                 // logs 5000
  console.log("x in closure = " + closure(4));        // logs 12
}

test(5000);                                           // passing in 5000 for the x in test
```

**Quirky/Broken Aspects of JS Scoping**

**Hoisting**

`var1` is the old way to declare variables. It has some funky problems. `let` is the new way. Probably best to use `let` for new JS code.

```javascript
"use strict";

function varTest() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("i = " + i);
  }
  console.log("i = " + i);           // logs i = 3 because decl var i hoisted out of loop.
}                                    // scope of i is function body.

console.log("var test:");
varTest();

function letTest() {
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    console.log("j = " + j);
  }
  console.log("j = " + j);          // logs Undefined because decl let j is out of scope.
}

console.log("let test:");
letTest();
```

**Closures referring to var-bound variables**

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i); // output 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
  }, 100);  
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i); // output 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 
  }, 100);  
}
```

### 6. Functions as Values###

Functions are widely used in JS for [callbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)). But [callback hell](http://stackabuse.com/avoiding-callback-hell-in-node-js/) is hell. We'll visit later.

On the other hand, a distinctly non-hellish use of functions is to use them in conjunction with `map`, `forEach`,  `filter` and `reduce`.

```javascript
let a = [1, 2, 3];

let b = a.map(n => n * 2);            // b = [2, 4, 6] a brand new list

a.forEach(n => console.log(n))        // logs 1, 2 and 3

let c = a.filter(n => n % 2 == 1);    // c = [1, 3]  only the odd numbers

let d = a.reduce((m, n) => m + n);    // d = 6, elements of a added together. (!)
```
