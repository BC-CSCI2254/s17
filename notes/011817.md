1-19-2017 revised plan

This directory and all subdirectories are tracked by a legacy svn
repository housed on cs.bc.edu. The s17/ directory is a public GitHub
repository containing all of the material contained published on
GitHub.  The admin/ and dev/ directories contain course related
material that should remain private, exams, pset solutions, etc.
