<P id="demo">

  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent
  a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
  all men are created equal.
</P>

<P>

  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
  any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on
  a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of
  that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives
  that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
  should do this.
</P>

<P>

  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can
  not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
  have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world
  will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never
  forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
  here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
  advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
  before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
  for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly
  resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under
  God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by
  the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
